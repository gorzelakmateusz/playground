Project Structure
The entire source code of the project is currently located within the typescript directory.
Please note: Although the directory is named typescript, the codebase is still written entirely in JavaScript. The migration or porting of the code to TypeScript has not yet been undertaken.

This setup is intentional to keep the project organized as we plan the transition to TypeScript. Future updates will focus on gradually rewriting the codebase to leverage TypeScriptâ€™s type safety and modern features.

For now, all development and maintenance happen in plain JavaScript, ensuring stability while preparing for a smooth and incremental migration process.
